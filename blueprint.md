# Blueprint: Calculator Application

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a modern, visually appealing calculator web application. The application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following modern web standards.

## Design and Features

2.  **CSS (`style.css`):** Style the calculator with a dark theme, rounded buttons, and a clear layout.
3.  **JavaScript (`main.js`):** Implement the core logic for the calculator, including handling button clicks, updating the display, and performing calculations.
